# Python Development Guidelines

## When to Use This Skill

- Python developers seeking quick reference for specific language features
- System programmers working with files, processes, and networking
- Backend developers implementing concurrent and asynchronous systems
- Data scientists and ML engineers working with PyTorch and distributed training
- Security engineers implementing cryptographic solutions
- Performance engineers optimizing Python with C/C++ extensions

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and modern Python idioms
- Use type hints and static analysis for better code maintainability
- Implement proper error handling and logging practices
- Choose appropriate concurrency models (threading vs multiprocessing vs asyncio)
- Apply security best practices and avoid common vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

- Understand when to use different data structures and algorithms
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks before optimization
- Consider memory usage patterns and garbage collection implications
- Use appropriate tools for CPU-bound vs I/O-bound operations
- Implement caching and connection pooling where beneficial

## Modern Python Practices

- Leverage pathlib for file system operations instead of os.path
- Use f-strings for string formatting and logging
- Apply context managers and the `with` statement for resource management
- Implement proper async/await patterns for concurrent programming
- Use dataclasses and enums for structured data representation
