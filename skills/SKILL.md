# Python Cheat Sheets (/py)

Dynamic Python reference combining local documentation with live examples from pythonsheets.com.

## How It Works

When you ask Python questions, I will:
1. **Fetch live examples** from https://www.pythonsheets.com/
2. **Enhance with local docs** if in the pysheeet repository
3. **Provide current, comprehensive answers** from the best available sources

## Coverage Areas

**Core:** Syntax, typing, OOP, functions, data structures
**System:** File I/O, datetime, OS interfaces
**Concurrency:** Threading, multiprocessing, asyncio
**Network:** Sockets, SSL/TLS, SSH, async I/O
**Database:** SQLAlchemy ORM, queries, transactions
**Security:** Cryptography, TLS, vulnerabilities
**Extensions:** C/C++ integration, pybind11, Cython
**ML/LLM:** PyTorch, distributed training, inference
**HPC:** Slurm, cluster computing, job scheduling

## References

For detailed information, I can access:
- **[Structure](references/structure.md)** - Complete topic-to-URL reference map
- **[Guidelines](references/guidelines.md)** - Code quality and best practices

## Quick Examples

- "How do I create async HTTP clients?" → Fetches https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/asyncio/python-asyncio-basic.html
- "Show me SQLAlchemy query patterns" → Fetches https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/database/python-sqlalchemy-query.html
- "Best practices for Python threading" → Fetches https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/concurrency/python-threading.html
- "Benchmark LLM serving with Slurm" → Fetches https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/llm/llm-bench.html

## Dynamic Examples

All code examples are loaded dynamically from the live website content at https://www.pythonsheets.com/. When local documentation is available, both sources are combined for comprehensive answers.
